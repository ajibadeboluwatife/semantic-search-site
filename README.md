# semantic-search-site
Cool semantic search engine using FastApi, Qdrant vector db and docker  Resources
Manuel Semantic Search Site
A tiny website with a centered search bar that performs semantic search over your products.
Runs locally on macOS using Docker: a FastAPI backend + Qdrant vector database + a minimal HTML UI.

Features
🔎 Natural-language search (embeddings) over product name & description
🧠 Local embeddings by default (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) — free, works fully offline
🔁 Easy reindex endpoint to ingest/refresh products
🧱 Minimal UI in one HTML file; simple to restyle
🐳 One docker compose up to run everything
Architecture (simple)
Browser (index.html)
    │  GET /            ──> FastAPI serves page
    │  GET /search?q=.. ──> FastAPI embeds query -> Qdrant search
    │                     <── JSON product results (payloads)
FastAPI (app.py)
    └── Qdrant (vectors + payloads)
Prerequisites
macOS with Docker Desktop installed and running
(Optional) curl for quick API testing

Getting Started (Quickstart)
From the project root:

# 1) Build and start containers
docker compose up --build

# 2) Open the site
open http://localhost:8000
Type something like “soft towels for hotels” and you’ll get semantic results from products.json.

On first run, the API creates a products collection in Qdrant and seeds it with the sample data.

Configuration
Environment variables (set inside docker-compose.yml):

QDRANT_URL — default http://qdrant:6333 (internal Docker hostname)
EMBEDDINGS_BACKEND — local (default) or openai
OPENAI_API_KEY — required only if EMBEDDINGS_BACKEND=openai
Indexing Your Data
Option A: JSON (easiest)
Replace api/products.json with your own data:

[
  {"id": "p1", "name": "Item Name", "description": "Details...", "price": 12.34, "url": "/product/p1"},
  ...
]
Then either:

# restart containers OR
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reindex
Option B: Pull from your SQL DB (optional)
Add your DB container (e.g., Postgres/MySQL) to docker-compose.yml.
In api/app.py, modify upsert_products() to query rows and build payloads:
# example shape:
payload = {"id": row.id, "name": row.name, "description": row.desc, "price": row.price, "url": row.url}
Rebuild & run:
docker compose up --build
API Endpoints
GET /
Returns the search page (centered search bar).

GET /search?q=your+query&top_k=8
Performs semantic search and returns payloads.

Example:

curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=soft%20spa%20towels&top_k=5"
POST /reindex
Re-embeds and upserts all products from products.json.

Example:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reindex
Switching Embeddings (Local ↔ OpenAI)
Local (default)
Pros: free, offline.
Cons: larger image (Torch), slower cold start.

Nothing to do — it's already set.

OpenAI (lighter image, possibly better quality)
In api/requirements.txt, remove:
sentence-transformers
torch
In docker-compose.yml, set:
environment:
  - EMBEDDINGS_BACKEND=openai
  - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your key...
In api/Dockerfile, remove the block that pre-downloads the local model.
Rebuild:
docker compose up --build
Styling the UI
Edit api/templates/index.html:

The page is pure HTML/CSS/JS; no framework required.
Adjust colors, fonts, layout, or add a logo.
The script calls /search and renders results as cards.
Development Workflow
Rebuild after Python dependency changes:
docker compose up --build
Hot reload (optional): add --reload to the uvicorn command in api/Dockerfile and mount the code directory as a volume in docker-compose.yml. For a simple, reproducible setup, the default is fine.
Data Model (payloads)
Each product is stored as:

{
  "id": "p123",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Text used for embeddings",
  "price": 19.99,
  "url": "/product/p123"
}
Embedding text = "{name} - {description}"
Qdrant stores vectors + payloads. Search returns top matches with full payload.
Common Tasks
Change top-k results: pass top_k in /search (default 8).
Filter by fields (advanced): Extend the search call in app.py with Qdrant filters (e.g., by category, availability).
Add fields: Just include extra keys in your payload; the UI shows name/description/price by default—update HTML to display more.
Troubleshooting
“Site doesn’t load”
Ensure Docker Desktop is running. Make sure port 8000 isn’t used by another process.

Qdrant not reachable
The API refers to Qdrant via http://qdrant:6333 (Docker network). Don’t change this unless you know what you’re doing.

Very slow first query
Local model may cold-load. Subsequent queries are faster. Consider switching to OpenAI embeddings for faster startup.

No results
Confirm products.json has data and that /reindex succeeded.

Torch wheel install is slow
That’s normal on first build. It’s cached afterward. If this is a blocker, switch to OpenAI embeddings.

Security Notes
This repo is for local use. Do not expose it to the public Internet without:
Auth (at least basic auth or a gateway)
Rate limiting
HTTPS/Proxy
Input validation/log redaction if you add write endpoints
Scaling Ideas (later)
Replace the HTML page with Next.js or your existing app; keep this FastAPI as an internal “semantic-search” service.
Add batch upserts and partial updates.
Add category/brand filters using Qdrant’s structured filters.
Persist Qdrant volume to keep indexes between runs (already configured via qdrant_data volume).
